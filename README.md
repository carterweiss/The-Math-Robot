# TheMathRobot
The Math Robot is a project that will hopefully create a computer program that can do math.  You can add small sections of code to this program and contribute to the .exe and .app file posted at the end of every month!
If you are not familiar with javax.swing, reading through existing code can help you learn, or you can go to Java's excellent documentation on this at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html.
